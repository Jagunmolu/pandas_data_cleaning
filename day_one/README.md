The task here is to make the data in the first sheet of "1.-Badly-Structured-Sales-Data-1.xlsx" to become like that of the second sheet.

This might not be the best way to approach the data cleaning but it works, I will hopefully clean it when I know better.

Also the data is not exactly like the expected return data but it is very close to it. Thereare 9 columns disparity which is due to the lack of some summary roles in the return data from the function.
